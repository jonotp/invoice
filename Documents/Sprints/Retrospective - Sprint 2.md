# Retrospective - Sprint 2

## Did well
- State management solution was good 
- GC Storage configuration for CORS complete
- Performed neccessary refactors
- Finished stories in the end

## Did not so well
### Estimates
- Fit way too much into the sprint 
- Velocity was greatly overestimated 
- Did not take other responsibilities into consideration 
- Extended the sprint by another week 

### Further research or data gathering before starting
- Did not do any unit testing
- Was stuck on UI 
- Was stuck on data modelling 
- Testing....

### Sprint Planning
- Should have a designated epic for the sprint so development work is related (had sign up in sprint but not sign in so hard to test)

## Improve upon
- Research more into the task (look at each task separately)
- Re-assess velocity (Halve it or double the sprint time??)
- Unit testing needs to be it's own sprint
- Break stories/tasks into epics
