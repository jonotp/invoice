# Brainstorm Solutions
```
Fire up your problem solving skills. Now is the time to think about specific solutions, how you'd implement them, and how the customer will interact with the final product. Involve your team, and be ambitious at this stage. It's easier to pare down a bold idea than to turn a safe idea into something innovative.

## Activities
### Disrupt
```
Generate a long list of great ideas in a short time.
```
- Invoicing wizard (help the user along the way)
- Store user profile so they only have to worry about customer and item 
- Store customer details so they only have to worry about item 
- Generate recurring invoices for a particular customer 
- Email invoices to customer (cc user)


### Mindmapping
```
Explore different facets of a problem, and organize your ideas for solutions.
```
Invoicing is tedious (can it be done quicker and with ease)?
Is the invoice i am giving the customer compliant?
Can I set up recurring invoice? 
Can I send the invoice to customer quickly?
