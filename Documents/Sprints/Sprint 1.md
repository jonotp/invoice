## Did well
- Coded each day so felt progress
- Was decisive about abandonning react-hook-forms and context to pass data 
- Learnt about react and react dev tools 
- Styling was quick because of material ui 
- Determined folder structure 

## Did not so well
- Did not priorities and focus on key parts 
- Did not start pdf generation
- Focused on styling which was not the point of the sprint
- Didn't draw out workflow and design
- Indecisive with form data and section 
- Focused too much on smaller task
- Did not do any unit testing

## Improve upon
- Priorise better- priority tasks first, leave styling later 
- Start with paper first before moving to code
