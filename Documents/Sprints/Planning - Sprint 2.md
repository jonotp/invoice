# Planning - Sprint 2
---
## Setup 
- Tools for pdf (puppeteer or something else)
- Firebase env test 

## Goals 
- To complete PDF generation 
- Store users data and authentication 
- Auto-populate form

## Tasks (in order of priority) 
- PDF Generation (8) - Highest
- Sign up page (2) - Highest
- Firebase store user data (5) - Highest
- Authenticated routes (5) - High
- Auto-populate form with authenticated user (1) - High
- Signout button (1) - Medium
- Popup to ask users if they want to save user changes (2) - Low

## Estimates on points & velocity 
- Estimated velocity is 19 across 5 working half days. Will be pushing this sprint because it contains 22 points with 2 points as a nice to have 
- (13) - 3 days to complete
- (8) - 2 days to complete
- (5) - 1 day to complete
- (3) - half day to complete
- (2) - Complete 4 in one day
- (1) - Complete 6 in one day 
 
## Potential Risks
- Won't get all tasks done on time
  - In this event focused on highest priority tasks
- Unit testing will delay developlment work (should they be added to story point?)
  - After this sprint will determine whether they should be added to story point
  - Get at least one unit test for task completed 
- PDF Generation has not been done before.... So may need to play with multiple solutions
  - Try to just make a pdf with all information
  - Style focus: Layout (separate sections), Positioning sections, Font, color, adornments
