# Risk 
```
Save yourself from headaches down the road. Think through ways the project might fail, and dive into prevention mode. Also identify chances for mind-blowing success that you haven't yet considered â€“ missed opportunities are a form of risk, too.

- PDF generation too difficult 
- GCP is costly 
- Tedious setup 
- Other responsibilities which take priority 
- Don't finish so have nothing to show
- People use the platform but haven't done the due diligence for it to generate proper income 
- No marketing so people don't use it 
- Only been devtested so won't see flaws untill later (Will need to get someone to test besides me)
