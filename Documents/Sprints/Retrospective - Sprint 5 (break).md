# Retrospective - Sprint 5

## Did well
- Took a break 

## Did not so well
- Didn't articulate why break was needed or record it anywhere
- Made plans to actualy think about models and work on the project. Didn't end up doing any of that
- Missed goals 

## Improve upon
- Shouldn't have goals other than take break during a sprint break 
- Understand that the agile being performed is still not perfect, need to continuously tweak as see fit
