# Retrospective - Sprint 4

## Did well
- Finished everything with MVP
- Alerts worked out well
- The decision to create another context for preloader and alerts instead of bulking it in with app context

## Did not so well
- Too caught up in styling
- Stories which are stlying focus were underestimate (loading)
- Unit tests were not catching errors made from refactoring (Could be because there was a lack of unit tests for contexts...)
- Did not take into account bug fixes from previous sprint 
- Feels like vision or road map needs to be re-evaluated
- Did not do any planning for the sprint so was certain what needed to be done
- Did not have enough time to add code to call the preloader where needed

## Improve upon
- Estimations to consider more than just functionality, acceptable styling and unit testing aswell 
- Planning for next sprint
