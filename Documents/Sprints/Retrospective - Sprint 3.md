# Retrospective - Sprint 3

## Did well
- Finished laying out the unit testing framework for front-end and back-end 
- Happy with understanding of framework and mocking of data
- Starting with video tutorials as a base was good (give practical experience and an idea of what to research later)
- Research and googling errors
- Previous implementation of contexts were good and made it easy for testing 
- Estimates were a lot better

## Did not so well
### Research
- Took a while to start because there were so many unknowns
- Wasted time trying to research while tired and would misinterpret docs

### Hindsight
- Realised the current folder structure is not ideal. Related components should be grouped in folders and each component separated into files 

### Attentiveness
- Commit messages and content (need to double check because there are spelling errors and things which should not be included)

## Improve upon
- Unit test before building component (TDD). ~ Estimated story points will need to change
- Overwhelmed with possibilities just start somewhere and refactor later 
- Double check commit mesages and code
- Folder and file structure. Try to separate components as much as possible
