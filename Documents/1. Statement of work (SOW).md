## Overview
The project is to make an invoice generating web-application. 

The purpose of this is to make invoicing easier for the self-employed / entrepenuer / small businesses (service provider) who does not have accountants etc. 

Don't want to spend time worrying about generating a compliant, consistent, professional invoice each time.

The project will achieve a fully functional invoice generating web-application with an option to register/subscribe to tailor the experience.
