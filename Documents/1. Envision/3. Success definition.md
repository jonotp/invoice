# Success Definition
```
Agree on measurable outcomes to shoot for, and metrics to track your progress toward them. Make sure the project contributes to larger objectives the business is pursuing. If it doesn't, this might be the wrong project (or it might be the right project, but at the wrong time).
```
- Completing sprint tasks on trello 
- Improve react skills
- Familarise with Google Cloud Platform products
