# Planning - Sprint 3
---
## Setup
- Unit testing suite for react
- Unit testing suite for firebase 

## Goals
- To have testing suites for both front-end and back-end
- To have completed a handful of tests for front-end and back-end

## Estimates on points & velocity
- Estimated velocity is 13 across 5 working days. Will be focused on unit testing mostly and if that is completed early can look at sprint planning for upcomming sprint
- (13) - 5 days to complete 
- (8) - 3 days to complete
- (5) - 2 days to complete
- (3) - 1 day to complete
- (2) - Complete 3 in one day 
- (1) - Complete 6 in one day

## Potential risks 
- Testing suite we choose is not ideal and have to switch
  - Research what testing suite can be used for react and firebase
- Can't test firebase effectively
  - Create tests for what can be tested 
- Stuck with where to put the testing suite (Research)
  - Front end put it in the react folder 
  - Firebase stuff put in separate test folder
